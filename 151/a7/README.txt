Reflection:
===========
I found this one to be more straightforward and that honestly felt like it was a trick. There were however things that were tricky
that became much simplier and taking a break.

Testing

All tests are labeled in the main method of the TernaryHeap class.

ABCs Test:
This test was to make sure it could take things in and out,(poll,peek and offer)

output:
a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z 
z y v x u s r q w t p o n m l k j i h g f e d c b a 

status:passed


Numbers Test:
This test is helpful in comparing the results of using a TernaryHeap to makesure it is the same as that of a BinaryHeap.
This test usees the word of a number as the key, and the intiger value of that number as the value.
Doing this ensures that they wont be added in numaric  order, which means later there is going have to restore heap order
and we can compare the results of ternary heap to binary heap to makesure the reults are the same. 

Printed results:

Numbers Ternary Heap
8 5 4 9 1 7 6 3 2 0 
Numbes Ternary Heap
8 5 4 9 1 7 6 3 2 0 

status:passed
